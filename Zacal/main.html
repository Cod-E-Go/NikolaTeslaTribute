            <div id="tribute-content"><p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
                <p>Tesla's patents and theoretical work helped lay the foundation for wireless communication and radio. His alternating current (AC) induction motor is considered one of the ten greatest discoveries of all time.</p>
                <p>Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 and worked with Thomas Edison before becoming a rival with his promotion of alternating current over Edison's direct current.</p>
                <p>Tesla's other notable inventions include the Tesla coil, a device that produces high-voltage, high-frequency alternating-current electricity, and the Tesla turbine.</p>
                <p>Despite facing financial difficulties and being largely unrecognized during his lifetime, Tesla's work has had a profound impact on the world, and he is now celebrated as one of the greatest inventors in history.</p>
